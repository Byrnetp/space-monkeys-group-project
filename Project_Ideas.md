## CSPB 3308 Project Ideas

### Services 

•	When a blood donation is made, record information about the donation (date, quantity) and donor (name, contact information, blood type).

•	When a blood transfusion is made, record information about the transfusion (date, quantity) and patient (name, contact information, blood type).

•	Determine how much of each type of blood a given blood bank has on hand.

•	Given a patient with need for blood, run a query to return the compatible, unexpired units of blood at the blood bank in order to match the patient with available blood. The output could either be all of the valid units or a subset of the valid units.

•	If there is a shortage of a certain type of blood, run a query to determine the eligible donors of that blood type to retrieve their contact information and send out a targeted appeal for blood donations.

•	If there is a patient who has experienced medical complications after receiving a blood transfusion, run a query to determine which other patients have received blood from the same donor to see if any of those patients have also experienced the same complications, to see if there might be an issue with the blood from that donor.

•	If a hospital needs a certain amount/type of blood, they can request it from another hospital.
