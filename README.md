### Vision statement: what would you tell potential customers? 
We would tell potential customers how much usable blood there is available, which hospital has the best type of blood for a transfusion for a specific individual, which hospitals are low on specific types of blood, when blood transfusions happen, when blood was donated, when hospitals shipped blood to another hospital.

### Motivation: why are you working on this project?
The motivation of this database program would be to safely provide as many patients/hospitals as possible with clean, unexpired, compatible blood.

To achieve this goal, the specific purposes of this application are several-fold:

1.	To keep records of blood donors and data about them (name, contact information, blood type, etc).For example, this could be used to send targeted messages to blood donors if there is a shortage of a certain blood type to encourage them to donate blood.

2.	To keep records of patients who have received blood and data about them (name, contact information, diagnosis, etc)For example, if there was ever a case of contaminated blood, this could be used to notify patients who received the blood that they should see their doctor

3.	To keep records about each donation (donor, quantity, blood bank, date, etc)

4.	This would be used to maintain the blood bank stock and traceability from donation to transfusion

5.	To keep records about each transfusion (patient, quantity, blood bank, date, etc)

6.	This would also be used to maintain the blood bank stock and traceability from donation to transfusion

7.	To keep stock of how much blood is in each blood bank. For example, this data could be used to trigger calls for donations if stock for a certain blood type fell below a threshold value

8.	To request blood from one hospital to another

Here are a few potential use cases:

•	When a blood donation is made, record information about the donation (date, quantity) and donor (name, contact information, blood type).

•	When a blood transfusion is made, record information about the transfusion (date, quantity) and patient (name, contact information, blood type).

•	Determine how much of each type of blood a given blood bank has on hand.

•	Given a patient with need for blood, run a query to return the compatible, unexpired units of blood at the blood bank in order to match the patient with available blood. The output could either be all of the valid units or a subset of the valid units.

•	If there is a shortage of a certain type of blood, run a query to determine the eligible donors of that blood type to retrieve their contact information and send out a targeted appeal for blood donations.

•	If there is a patient who has experienced medical complications after receiving a blood transfusion, run a query to determine which other patients have received blood from the same donor to see if any of those patients have also experienced the same complications, to see if there might be an issue with the blood from that donor.

### Risks to project completion, possibly including:
•	new language or working environment

•	no prior experience working with these team members

•	lack of some needed resources

### Mitigation Strategy for above risks

### Development method: scrum, kanban, waterfall: with specifics!
